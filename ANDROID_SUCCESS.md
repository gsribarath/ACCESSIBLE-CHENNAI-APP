# 🎉 Your App is Ready for Android!

## Current Status: ✅ Capacitor Setup Complete

You've successfully converted your web app to Android! The build failed due to network timeout, but here are several ways to proceed:

---

## Option 1: Try Building Again (Network Issue)

The timeout was just a network issue downloading Gradle. Try again:

```bash
cd D:\Accessiblechennai\chennai\frontend\android
.\gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon
```

If it still times out, try with a VPN or different network.

**Download**: https://developer.android.com/studio

### After installation:
1. Open Android Studio
2. Select "Open an existing project"
3. Navigate to: `D:\Accessiblechennai\chennai\frontend\android`
4. Let Android Studio sync and download dependencies
5. Click the green "Run" button
6. Your app will install on connected device/emulator!
