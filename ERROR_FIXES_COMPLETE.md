# 🛠️ Community and Settings Pages - Error Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Voice Interface Hook Issues**
- **Problem**: `useVoiceInterface` was expecting parameters that weren't being passed
- **Solution**: Simplified the hook to not require external parameters
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `utils/voiceUtils.js` - Removed dependency on external `preferences` and `getText`
  - All page components - Updated to call `useVoiceInterface()` without parameters

### 2. **isVoiceMode Variable Issues**
- **Problem**: Pages were trying to get `isVoiceMode` from the voice hook
- **Solution**: Calculate `isVoiceMode` directly from preferences in each component
- **Implementation**: `const isVoiceMode = preferences.mode === 'voice';`
