# Android Studio Setup for Capacitor

## Current Status: ✅ Capacitor Setup Complete!

You've successfully set up Capacitor! Now you need Android Studio to run the app.

## Option 1: Install Android Studio (Recommended)

### Download and Install:
1. **Download Android Studio**: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Install** with default settings
3. **Open Android Studio** and complete initial setup
4. **Install Android SDK** (API level 33 or higher)

### After Installation:
```bash
# Set environment variable (optional)
$env:CAPACITOR_ANDROID_STUDIO_PATH = "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\bin\studio64.exe"

# Then run:
npx cap open android
```

## Option 2: Build APK without Android Studio

If you want to test quickly without Android Studio:

### Install Java JDK:
```bash
# Install via Chocolatey (if you have it)
choco install openjdk11

# Or download from: https://adoptium.net/
```

### Build APK directly:
```bash
cd android
.\gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK will be in: `android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`

---

## Option 3: Use Android Emulator Online

### 1. Upload your APK to:
- **APK Online**: https://appetize.io/
- **BrowserStack**: https://www.browserstack.com/app-live
- **AWS Device Farm**: https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/

### 2. Test in browser without installing anything

## Option 4: Test on Physical Device

### Requirements:
- Android device with USB debugging enabled
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

### Steps:
1. **Enable Developer Options** on your Android device:
   - Go to Settings > About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Go back to Settings > Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging"

2. **Install ADB** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # Via Chocolatey
   choco install adb
   
   # Or download Android Platform Tools
   ```

3. **Connect device and install**:
   ```bash
   # Check if device is connected
   adb devices
   
   # Install APK
   adb install android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
   ```

## Quick Test (Recommended):

Since you have everything set up, I recommend:

1. **Download Android Studio** (runs in background)
2. **Build APK now** while Android Studio downloads:

```bash
cd android
.\gradlew assembleDebug
```

3. **Test APK on device or emulator**

---

## Next Steps After Android Studio:

Once you have Android Studio:

1. **Open project**: `npx cap open android`
2. **Connect device** or **start emulator**
3. **Click Run** (green play button)
4. **Your app will install and launch!**

## Your App Features Will Work:

✅ **Voice Recognition** - Web Speech API works in WebView
✅ **Maps** - Google Maps/OpenStreetMap will work
✅ **Navigation** - All your React components work
✅ **Accessibility** - Screen readers work with WebView
✅ **Backend API** - HTTP requests work normally

The app is essentially your web app running in a native container!

Would you like me to help you with any of these options?
